# README

Rocksmith is a personal project aimed at assisting tracking the songs played on the Rocksmith games by Ubisoft. Sady, the develepors not longer add to the song packs in favour of the subscription based model that the Rocksmith Plus is based on.

Currently setting up the project and adding tools to assist the production of the project, I'm about to add Guard to assist in automatic checking of changes to the project, and displaying the webpages automatically when changed.

Next steps include (in no particular order) are

* adding simple authentication (including adding an admin option)
* getting the project to run under docker to run the app on windows (mainly as I have to run Rocksmith in the Windows environment)
* adding Lookbook for setting up View Components
* lots of other things I haven't yet though about!

## Tasks started, but incomplete

* Lookbook added, and running but no classes have been added
* Guard

## Working on

* Adding guard to run brakeman
